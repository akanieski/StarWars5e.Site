When he was 6, Diskar's family mysteriously disappeared. In the wreckage of their camp, all that was left of his entire clan was him and an old mandoviol his father had given him. He was lost on the station alone, wandering the compartments for about a month before he was picked up by another clan of Ryn, who would travel the inner rim. Unfortunately, this clan hated his clan, and while they didn't want to kill the young boy, they treated him as a slave, forcing him to do all the dirty work and hard labor of the clan. He had little free time, but what he did have, he spent tinkering on his own projects, or practicing his father's Mandoviol. Due to his hard work, he learned to fix pretty much anything, as well as how to figure problems out.  Despite all the trials they put him through, Diskar keeps a cheerful disposition, and always tried to keep others happy. His efforts paid off, and as he grew up, the clan started to treat him better, eventually using him as their pilot. Eventually, 20 years later, he heard a rumor that his family's disappearance was connected with the mysterious disappearance of the Sith Emperor. Thats when he learned that the republic army was accepting new recruits, with the intent of finding the emperor. He joined with the intent of finding his family."},"credits":1050,"equipment":[{"name":"Wristpad","quantity":1,"category":"Equipment"},{"name":"Tinker's implements","quantity":1,"category":"Equipment"},{"name":"Clothes, common","quantity":1,"category":"Equipment"},{"name":"Light pistol","quantity":1,"category":"Equipment","equipped":true},{"name":"Combat suit","quantity":1,"category":"Equipment","equipped":true},{"name":"Backpack","quantity":1,"category":"Equipment"},{"name":"Commlink","quantity":1,"category":"Equipment"},{"name":"Bedroll","quantity":1,"category":"Equipment"},{"name":"Blanket","quantity":1,"category":"Equipment"},{"name":"Power cell","quantity":1,"category":"Equipment"},{"name":"Grappling hook","quantity":1,"category":"Equipment"},{"name":"Mandoviol","quantity":1,"category":"Equipment"}],"currentStats":{"hitPointsLost":0,"temporaryHitPoints":0,"techPointsUsed":2,"forcePointsUsed":0,"superiorityDiceUsed":0,"hitDiceUsed":{"d8":0},"deathSaves":{"successes":0,"failures":0},"hasInspiration":false,"featuresTimesUsed":{},"conditions":[],"exhaustion":0,"highLevelCasting":{"level6":false,"level7":false,"level8":false,"level9":false}},"tweaks":{"abilityScores":{"Intelligence":{"score":{"bonus":1,"override":null},"skills":{"Lore":{"proficiency":"Proficient"},"Piloting":{"proficiency":"Expertise"},"Technology":{"proficiency":"Expertise"},"Investigation":{"proficiency":"Proficient"},"Nature":{"proficiency":"Proficient"}}},"Charisma":{"skills":{"Performance":{"proficiency":"Proficient"}}},"Dexterity":{"score":{"bonus":null,"override":null}},"Wisdom":{"skills":{"Medicine":{"proficiency":"Proficient"},"Perception":{}}}}},"customProficiencies":[{"name":"Mechanic's kit","type":"tool","proficiencyLevel":"proficient"},{"name":"Sabacc deck","type":"tool","proficiencyLevel":"proficient"},{"name":"Mandoviol","type":"tool","proficiencyLevel":"proficient"},{"name":"Tinker's implements","type":"tool","proficiencyLevel":"proficient"},{"name":"Cybertech's implements","type":"tool","proficiencyLevel":"proficient"}],"customLanguages":["Ryn","Binary"],"customFeatures":[],"customFeats":["Techie","Force-Sensitive"],"customTechPowers":["Repair Droid"],"customForcePowers":["Force Shunt","Force Whisper"],"customEquipment":[{"name":"Staff of the Swirling Flare","quantity":1,"equipmentCategory":"Weapon","cost":0,"description":"Standard Enhanced Item, Requires No Attunement.
